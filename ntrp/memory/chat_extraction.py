Return facts worth remembering permanently — things useful to recall months later.

EXTRACT:
- Decisions: "User chose Postgres for the project" (not both sides — just the outcome)
- Preferences: "User prefers raw SQL over ORMs"
- People and roles: "Maria leads frontend", "Artem is User's brother"
- Deadlines and commitments: "MVP deadline is March 15th"
- Personal details: locations, routines, background

SKIP:
- Transient project state: current blockers, active tasks, feature requirements
- Action items: "need to add X", "should set up Y" — these are tasks, not knowledge
- Procedural steps: "ran pip install", "edited the config"
- Troubleshooting and debugging
- Tool outputs and code snippets
- Both sides of the same decision — only the outcome matters
- Inferences not directly stated in the conversation

RULES:
- Each fact must be atomic and concrete (one idea per fact)
- Use "User" for first-person references
- Only state what was explicitly said — do not infer or add context
- Prefer fewer high-quality facts over many low-quality ones
- If nothing durable was discussed, return an empty list

CONVERSATION:
