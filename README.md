# ntrp

**ntrp** is entropy – the measure of disorder in a system. Your calendar, emails, notes, browser tabs, half-remembered conversations – it all accumulates. This project exists to reduce it.

I built this for myself. ADHD and scattered attention meant I kept losing track of things (e.g. what I said, what I planned, what I was supposed to follow up on). So I made an assistant that hooks into my stuff and actually remembers.

## What it does

- **Persistent memory**: learns facts and patterns across conversations, consolidates them over time
- **Scheduled tasks**: morning briefings, daily reviews, health tracking – runs autonomously on a schedule
- **Connected sources**: Obsidian vault, Gmail, Google Calendar, browser history, web search (so far)
- **Shell access**: runs commands, manages files, sends emails
- **Any LLM**: Claude, GPT, Gemini built-in; OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via custom models
